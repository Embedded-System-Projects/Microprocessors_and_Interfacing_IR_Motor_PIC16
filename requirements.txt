                     # Steps for successful simulation

=> Step 1: open IR-Motor-PIC16 proteus project
=> Step 2: double click on the pic16877A Microcontroller, 
           go to the program file row and click the folder icon
=> Step 3: find and click on main.hex inside the hex file folder
=> Step 4: and again double click on the infra red sensor, go to the 
           program file row and click the folder icon
=> Step 5: find and click on InfraredSensorsTEP.HEX inside the Hex folder
=> Step 6: Finally its done! you may now run the simulation!
